# Functional programming

**Function programming** is all about **separation of concerns**: separating data and function.

FP generally has a preference for simplicity and single purpose. Functions do one thing very well.

Above is in essence a **pure function**:

- Given the same input you always get the same output;
- There are no side effects.

The first principle is also called **referential transparency**.
