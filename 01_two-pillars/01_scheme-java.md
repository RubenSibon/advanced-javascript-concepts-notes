# Scheme + Java

Brendan Eick was inspired by Scheme and Java.

The Java "part" and the OOP paradigm was kinda forced upon him.

Scheme was a language developed at MIT in the '70s. It was a flexible, multiparadigm language that introduced concepts such as closures and functional programming. It is one of the three main dialects of Lisp: Common Lisp, Closure and Scheme.
