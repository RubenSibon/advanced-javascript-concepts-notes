# Functions: First Class Citizens

Functions are data.

Functions are `object`s.

They can be **passed** around in other functions and **returned** by other functions.

They can be stored inside variables (**function expressions**).

Anything you can do with any other type you can do with functions.

This opens up exciting possibilities for **functional programming**.
