# Higher Order Functions (HOF)

_Don't hassle the Hoff!_

## Powerful and an easy definition

```
function() < function(a,b) < HOF
```

A **Higher Order Function** (HOF) is a function that takes a **function as an argument** or **returns a function**.

## But why are HOF's useful and how to use them properly?

Yeah?
